<h1 style="color:#F9D199; font-size:30px; font-family:Garamond; text-align: justify;"> Coastal Erosion is caused by human activity and natural environment changes that cause the coastal dynamic action (wave, current, and wind) to get out of balance with the coastal process. This imbalance is caused by the long-term loss of sediments of the coastal zone.</h1>
<p style="color:#F9D199; font-size:30px; font-family:Garamond; text-align: justify;">Transgression is not the same as the concept of coastal erosion. Transgression, also known as sea forwarding, refers to the significant shoreline landward shift brought on by relative long-term sea level rise. It is the geological process of sea and land transformation. Transgression is formed as a result of the planet's tectonic evolution and sea level rise, and it has a far greater spatial distribution and a much longer duration than coastal erosion. The term "coastal erosion" and "seawater intrusion" are not interchangeable. Seawater intrusion refers to the process of seawater traveling over the porous layer into the terrestrial strata.<p>
<p style="color:#F9D199; font-size:30px; font-family:Garamond; text-align: justify;"> Currently, 70% of the world's sandy coastlines have signs of coastal erosion, which is quite widespread and present everywhere. Seawater is consuming coastal land, forcing coastal villages and homes inland, which reduces human living space, destroys beach biodiversity and environmental balance, and negatively impacts both human life and the environment in direct or indirect ways. As a result, coastal erosion has gone from being a normal aspect of the environment to a major threat.<p>
